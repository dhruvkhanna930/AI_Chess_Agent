# AI Chess Agent

Welcome to AI Chess Agent! This project implements an AI chess opponent using heuristics-based search and alpha-beta pruning for move evaluation. We have Developed an AI chess opponent, leveraging heuristics-based AI to analyze board positions and prioritize moves. This project aims to create a competitive AI chess opponent using alpha-beta pruning and other techniques.

## Installation

To install and run the AI Chess Opponent, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dhruvkhanna930/AI_Chess_Agent.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd AI_Chess_Agent
    ```

3. Install dependencies (assuming you have Python and pip installed):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the program:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```


## Usage

Once the program is running, you can start playing chess against the AI opponent. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves and interact with the game.



## Features

- Heuristics-based AI for analyzing board positions and prioritizing moves.
- Alpha-beta pruning optimization for enhancing decision-making.
- Adjustable search depth to manage computational complexity.
- Focus on legal moves to ensure adherence to the game's rules.
